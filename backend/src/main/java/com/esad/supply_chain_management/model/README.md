# Documentation - Model Class

All Model Classes (Entity Classes) have been defined via Spring Data JPA with Hibernate.
The relational database has been created using an ORM, hence no SQL was used during DB creation.

## OOP Concepts Practised 

OOP Concepts were applied throughout the implementation, however, for the model class implementation, the following were applied.
1. Encapsulation
2. Inheritance
3. Abstraction

## Relationship Mapping

All relationships were mapped using JPA via the use of annotations `@ManyToMany`, `@ManyToOne` `@OneToMany`
